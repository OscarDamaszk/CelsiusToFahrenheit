# CelsiusToFahrenheit
A C++ program created in CS-210 with the purpose of converting an input text file of cities and their temperatures in Celsius to Fahrenheit, with creating an output file.

What did you do particularly well?
The commented code does a good job of describing what different sections of code are being used for, explaining the importance of each section.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think the code could be enhanced more by creating a class with functions that can be referenced and reused in the main section of the code. This would allow the functions to be reused in both this project and other projects if necessary. Additionally, the code could benefit from an option that allows the user to use the formula in order to convert a single input from Celsius to Fahrenheit. If this code were to be used in a more scientific scenario, offering an option that allows the user to choose which temperature scale to use, such as converting to Kelvin, Fahrenheit, or Celsius.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
While nothing was necessarily difficult, the most  challenging code to write was the while loop of outputing the results into another file, as my first attempt was done without the "endl" at the end of the 43rd line, resulting in an output file with one single long line of text, rather than a long list.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The use of a separate file for input as well as outputting results into a new file will be a good skill to keep going forward, as it will make going through a large text file of information easier, rather than having to manually input information.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The spacing of the code, the comments, and using names for variables that describe what they are being used for make the code incredibly readable and informative. The lack of unnecessary lines of code makes the program maintainable.
